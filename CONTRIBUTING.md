# How to Contribute

Thanks for taking the time to bring your contributions back to the community. We are excited to collaborate with you! 

First of all take some time to go through our contributor code of conduct. We expect all members to uphold it.

## Code of conduct

As a contributor to this project and with the interest of fostering an open and welcoming community, we pledge respect to all people who contribute, submit pull requests, report issues, post feature requests, update the documentation and engage in other community activities.

As a commitment to participants in this project we want to offer a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, or nationality.

Any deviation from this conduct entitles project maintainers to remove, edit or reject comments, commits, issues etc or temporarily / permanently ban any contributor that is deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive or harmful.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/), version 1.3.0, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/3/0/)

If you have some feedback that you want to share, please go to [Issues](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-mobile-workspace-ios/issues) and open a new issue. It's important to pay attention and follow the issue templates that are provided to make sure you offer an in-depth level of detail to avoid any un-necessary follow-ups.
Additionally, make use of the available labels to enhance your issue with information such as: `bug`, `feature request`, `question`.

# Making a Pull Request

## Before you Start

If you are just starting out and want to familiarize youself with the application code we suggest looking at [these issues](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-mobile-workspace-ios/labels/good%20first%20issue) that have the `good first issue` label attached with are suitable for newcomers, otherwise you are welcome to tackle any of the open issues.

We are aiming to avoid duplicate work effort so if you decide to work on an open issue leave a comment to state your intent. Sometimes the necessary work to address an issue is great and for that reason we recommend you wait for one of the maintainer's response before committing to make a certain contribution. 

It could be the case that the reported issue does not align with the project goals.
For that reason it's best to address and discuss the issue beforehand.

## Coding Standards

Descriptive and consistent naming makes software easier to read and understand. Use the Swift naming conventions described in the [API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)

We use Swiftlint to reinforce some of guidelines and that may be subject to change so keep [an eye on it](https://github.com/Alfresco/alfresco-mobile-workspace-ios/blob/master/.swiftlint.yml). For convenience it's already integrated in the project so make sure you're on the latest version before making your PR.

## Code reviews

All external submissions require formal review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult  [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)  for more information on using pull requests.
